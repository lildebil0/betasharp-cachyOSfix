An enhanced version of Minecraft Beta 1.7.3, ported to C#.

# Notice

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is based on decompiled Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 code and requires a legally purchased copy of the game.\
> We do not support or condone piracy. Please purchase Minecraft from https://www.minecraft.net.

## Running

The launcher is the recommended way to play. It authenticates with your Microsoft account and starts the client automatically. \
Clone the repository and run the following commands.

```
cd BetaSharp.Launcher
dotnet run --configuration Release
```

## Building

Clone the repository and make sure the .NET 10 SDK is installed. For installation, visit https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download. \
The Website lists instructions for downloading the SDK on Windows, macOS and Linux.

It is recommended to build with `--configuration Release` for better performance. \
The server and client expect the JAR file to be in their running directory.

```
cd BetaSharp.(Launcher/Client/Server)
dotnet build
```

# Verification Walkthrough: Linux Renderer Bug Fix (Issue #141)

## What was Changed
The rendering offset bug on Linux window managers (such as Wayland or Niri) was fixed by differentiating between the **logical window size** and the **physical framebuffer size**.

- **Added Framebuffer awareness:** Expanded `Display.cs` with `getFramebufferWidth()` and `getFramebufferHeight()` which fetch the pixel resolution directly from Silk.NET's `IWindow.FramebufferSize`.
- **Viewport Fix:** Upgraded `GLManager.GL.Viewport()` calls in `BetaSharp.cs` and `GameRenderer.cs` to utilize the Framebuffer dimensions instead of the logical window boundaries.
- **FBO Sizing Fix:** Updated `PostProcessManager` initialization and resizing to create Framebuffer Objects (FBOs) matching the physical Framebuffer size. This fixes an issue where drawing a full-resolution Native Viewport inside a smaller Logical-Size FBO caused the image to appear cropped.
- **Screenshot Fix:** Updated screenshot functionality (`ReadPixels`) to read exact pixel quantities scaled to the Framebuffer, ensuring captured screenshots mirror exactly what is rendered without boundary cutoff.

## Validation Status
- **Compilation Check (`dotnet build`)**: Passed successfully with 0 errors.

## Next Steps for User
Since this issue is specific to the Linux testing environment, please run the game and verify the following:
1. Start the game in windowed mode. Ensure the black top bar has disappeared.
2. The UI scaling behaves correctly alongside the rendered environment.
3. Try taking an in-game screenshot (`F2`) to confirm images are captured correctly and match your screen dimensions.

## 1.1 Supplemental Fixes (Fullscreen & macOS Sound)
- **Fullscreen Cursor / Stretch Alignment Fix:** An issue where pressing `F11` would cause the window projection to assume the fullscreen desktop unscaled resolution (stretching the picture and throwing off the GUI cursor scaling coordinates) was caught. Fix was applied in `Display.cs` and `toggleFullscreen` inside `BetaSharp.cs` to correctly retain the window's true logical bounds during viewport resizing.
- **macOS Sound Effects Mute Fix:** macOS OpenAL instances are known to entirely drop Stereo audio buffers if `RelativeToListener = false` and `Position` properties (spatialization functions) are called on them. Updated `SoundManager.cs` to detect multi-channel sound effect loading, and bypass 3D spatialization for them forcing `RelativeToListener = true`, allowing macOS to successfully play SFML.Audio Sound FX.
